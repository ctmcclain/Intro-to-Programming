# Intro-to-Programming
WVU online course that will end with a two day face to face  conference
I am excited about getting involved in this online course.
I currently teach in a WV Tech School,  I teach both robotics, web development and gaming. I am hoping this course will help me to better understand myself so I can share with my students.
